        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p>I'm a curious soul, always eager to understand and learn from life. One of the things I love the most is the sea because it brings me peace and a profound sense of freedom, ideals that I endeavour to apply in my profession. Additionally, I take delight in exploring the creative realms of architecture, art, and classical music, firmly believing that the embrace of various art forms fosters our intellectual and social growth.</p>
        <p>I hold a deep affection for animals, cherish human connections, and find solace in smiles and warm hugs.</p>
