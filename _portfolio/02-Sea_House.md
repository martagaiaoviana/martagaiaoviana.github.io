<!-- Project Text -->
<div class="my-5">
  <p>
    This apartment, located in <span class="fw-bold">Ap√∫lia, Esposende, Portugal</span>, was designed with the sea as its primary inspiration. Drawing from the surrounding coastal environment, the concept embraces nature, calmness, and spatial balance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project highlights a harmonious relationship between interior and exterior through natural materials, soft tones, and an open layout that reflects the fluidity of the sea and the tranquillity of the landscape.
