  <p>
    The project, developed in the <span class="fw-bold">fourth year of the Integrated Master’s in Architecture at the Faculty of Architecture, University of Porto (2020)</span>, proposed a <span class="fw-bold">student residence combined with cultural spaces</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The design emphasized the interaction between private and collective life, where the <span class="fw-bold">student rooms</span> ensured comfort and community, while the <span class="fw-bold">cultural spaces</span> were conceived with several possible configurations, allowing flexibility to adapt to different social and cultural contexts.
