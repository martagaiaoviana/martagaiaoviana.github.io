<!-- Project Text -->
<div class="my-5">
  <p>
    In the apartment situated in <span class="fw-bold">Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal</span>, our intention was to amplify the presence of nature already existing in the courtyard. From this approach, we envisioned a flexible studio (T0) that fully benefits from its windows and solar orientation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project emphasizes the integration of greenery into the living space, highlighted through carefully selected color accents, creating a balance between adaptability, light, and a sense of connection with nature.
