The project for the apartment situated in **Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal** is an exercise in amplifying the relationship between domestic space and the surrounding natural context.  

Although located in an urban environment, the apartment benefits from a courtyard that preserves traces of greenery. Building on this presence, the intervention seeks to enhance natureâ€™s role as an active component of living, while rethinking the adaptability of contemporary housing.  

The courtyard becomes a central element, guiding the design as both a source of light and a reference to the rhythms of nature. The flexible studio typology (T0) is oriented to take full advantage of its windows and solar orientation, fostering a spatial balance between openness and intimacy. Through carefully selected color accents, the project reinforces the integration of greenery inside the home, creating subtle transitions between indoor and outdoor.  

In architectural terms, the proposal highlights flexibility and coexistence, promoting a sense of continuity between space, light, and natural elements. By emphasizing adaptability and connection with nature, the project affirms a contemporary, sensitive approach to inhabiting.
